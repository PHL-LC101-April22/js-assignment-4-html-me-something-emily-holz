            <h1>Surviving LaunchCode With My "Assistants" </h1>
         
   
            <h2 id = "intro paragraph">Are three heads better than one?</h1>
             <p>Usually, right? If we are talking about three adults capabale of independently taking 
                care of themselves? Yes! Give me more team work brain power, because coding can be HARD! 
             </p>
             <p>
                What I've actually got is two teeny human heads and mine. One is just 3 months and the other is 
               almost two, and boy are those "terrible two tantrums" a thing. Our days are filled 
               with lots of milk, diaper changes, snacks, toys, messes, tears, and laughs. But somewhere in there, 
               often at night when the energy tank is running on fumes, Mommy is hustling. I am on a mission
               to learn to code. I am a middle school teacher on maternity leave, burned out in just four short years
               in the profession. I love what I do, but I know it's not a career I can mentally handle while taking 
               care of two kids at home, and I am ready for a change. 
            </p>
            <p> Anyway, my "little assistants" have been with me every step of the way through LaunchCode.
               It's a challenge. Here's my survival guide.
            </p>

            <h2>Survival Tips</h2>
               <ol>
                  <li>Have a plan and be intentional with your time. 
                   <p> Anyone who has taken care of young children knows, you don't get much solo time. For instance,
                  if I am home alone with the kids (which is most weekdays 7:30 - 5:30), I know I really only reliably have about
                  30 minutes to myself when their naps overlap. Otherwise, my time to work is after bedtime, 7pm. So naturally, 
                  most work gets done at night.
                  Having a plan is knowing when you can work and chunking out what you will work on when. For example, "On Tuesday evening, 
                  my goal is to read and take notes on all of chapter 22. On Wednesday, I will complete the exercises for chapter 22, etc."
                  Being intentional with your time is focusing on accomplishing your daily goals, since you know your available time 
                  to keep up with classwork is limited!</p>
                  </li>
                   <li> Surround yourself with support. 
                   <p>Sure Moms and Dads are superheros. But it's also an unrealistic expectation to do it all on your own. I would not be able to do this work without my 
                  husband's love and support. He knows how important LaunchCode is to me. He always tags in when I really just need to sit and
                  devote more time and focus to LaunchCode work. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>Have a special LaunchCode Bedtime Routine.
                  <p>Oh the bedtime routine. My most favorite time of day. Bath time, books, and snuggles. Followed by, of course, quiet. Usually, my husband and
                  I divide and conquer and each take a kid. But, since class occurs during betime, it's pivotal to have some sort of plan in place for the routine.
                  Otherwise, two screaming babies in the background does not at all help you focus during lecture. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li> Keep yourself nourished and happy.
                  <p>Taking care of kids is hard work. You are totally absorbed by the constant responsibility of keeping them 
                  alive and moving them through day to day routines and tasks (not always easily either). So many snacks and crumbs and tears. 
                  You are essentially a comfort dispenser, an entertainer, and a chef. But remember, you are a human, too!! You need food. You need 
                  to be nourished. Even if its at 9pm, eat a meal for yourself. No, those chicken nugget leftovers on your toddlers plate
                  are not enough. Take 20 minutes, and have yourself a meal. It sounds silly, but its surprising how many times 
                  I've just grabbed myself an apple sauce packet or two and called it lunch - sad. 
                  Having a plan is knowing when you can work and chunking out what you will work on when. For example, "On Tuesday evening, 
                  my goal is to read and take notes on all of chapter 22. On Wednesday, I will complete the exercises for chapter 22, etc."
                  Having a plan is knowing when you can work and chunking out what you will work on when. For example, "On Tuesday evening, 
                  my goal is to read and take notes on all of chapter 22. On Wednesday, I will complete the exercises for chapter 22, etc."</p>
                   <p> As for keeping yourself happy? I mean surround yourself with your little joys. I like candles. I like being freshly showered.
                   I like fresh flowers. I like good music. I like a clean environment. I like to snack on dried mango and drink flavored Wegman's seltzers.
                  All of these things put me in a better mood. Good Mood Emily is immensely more motivated, engaged, and calm. </p> 
                  </li>
                  <li>And when things get tough...
                   <p> Look at your babies. You can do hard things.
